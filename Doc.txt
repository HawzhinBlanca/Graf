Project Structure and Architecture
Your application, "Graf", is a macOS app built with Swift, SwiftUI, and Metal. It's designed for visualizing 4D geometric objects with various projection techniques. The main components include:
Entry Points:
 serves as the entry point using NSApplicationMain
GrafApp.swift defines the SwiftUI app structure
AppDelegate.swift contains standard app delegate implementation
Core Components:
GrafRenderer.swift - Main Metal renderer
GrafMetalView.swift - SwiftUI wrapper for Metal view
GA4D.swift - Geometric Algebra implementation (large file with 1566 lines)
GA4DVisualizer.swift - 4D visualization logic
GA4DOptimizer.swift - Performance optimization for geometric operations
GA4DCrossSection.swift - 3D cross-section generation for 4D objects
GA4DPrimitives.swift - Basic 4D geometric primitives (tesseract, hypersphere, etc.)
Shaders.metal - Metal shaders for rendering
User Interface:
ContentView.swift - Main UI with controls for visualization parameters
CrossSectionView.swift - UI for managing cross-sections
CrossSectionModel.swift - Model for cross-section data
Execution Flow
The app launches via main.swift and sets up the SwiftUI window through GrafApp
ContentView initializes a GrafRenderer and creates a GrafMetalView to display the rendering
The UI provides controls for:
Visualization types (Tesseract, Hypersphere, Duocylinder, Clifford Torus, etc.)
Projection methods (Stereographic, Perspective, Orthographic)
Rendering options (Wireframe, Normals, Resolution, Scale, Animation Speed)
Debug mode
The renderer processes 4D objects and projects them to 3D for display:
GA4D.swift provides the geometric algebra foundation
GA4DPrimitives.swift defines the 4D objects
GA4DVisualizer.swift handles the visualization logic
GrafRenderer.swift connects to Metal for rendering
Metal shaders in Shaders.metal perform the final rendering
